## Lab Organization 

* **Lab Notebooks** are property of the lab and will digital and be backed up regularly (Bonus--you can keep a copy to use as a reference when you leave the lab!). I recommend using Microsoft OneNote and following the practices recommended here. https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006918 I suggest labbies use the YYYY/MM/DD datestamp format because it's easiest to sort numerically. 
    * If you make scratch paper notes, take photos & attach it to your notebook.  Same with scratch calculations in excel -- screenshots. If you are transitioning from a paper labnotebook, you can also use photos --> OneNote as an interim solution. 
    * Notebook should be completed by the end of the week. 
    * Notebook should be backed up monthly to the cloud (automatically preferred).
    * Although your data is the property of the lab, a digital lab notebook is in your best interest.  You'll always be able to look back at the methods you optimized & potentially write your papers on a beach / coffee shop / ski lodge in Tahoe. 

* **Lab protocols** are hosted on Github: https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols. 
    * Create a Github account for yourself and apply for an [academic account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) to have the option of private repositories. I expect all repositories to be shared within the lab and any validated data or protocol to eventually be publicly published and shared with the scientific community. 
    * As we optimize/improve/change protocols, please commit updates to the shared lab protocols, and list yourself as a contributer. 
    * Github allows us to have version control on protocols, so it's possible to retrieve previous versions of protocols. 

* **Strain lists:** Work-In Progress strains/plasmids should be kept in personal freezer boxes, which is a short-to-medium term storage. Once validated I expect strains & plasmids to be added to the core strain inventory (detailed in the ["Glycerol stocks" lab protocol](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/protocols/blob/master/glycerol_stocks.md)). All validated plasmids should be added to a core folder on the lab's Benchling account. 
    * I encourage everyone to do monthly audits of their strains and make sure any confirmed strains are moved to the permanent collection & incorrect strains are put in biohazard waste.
