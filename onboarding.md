# Onboarding

Important information for new hires. We highly recommend getting a UCD email address before arriving.  This will allow you to complete online safety training before arriving in the lab. 

In addition to the content here, the [Maloof lab](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/wiki/) at UC Davis has some great information.

## Before you work in the lab
A lot of this information applies throughout your tenure in the Lowe-Power lab. 

### Expectations

Familiarize yourself with the [lab expectations](expectations.md).

### **Safety**

http://plantpathology.ucdavis.edu/safety.cfm

* UCD **Online safety training** through (LMS)[https://lms.ucdavis.edu/] aka UC Learning Center. Look for the courses below in `Required Training`. If you do not see them, use the `Find A Course` search. If all else fails, email the plant pathology Safety guru Andy Ross (abross@ucdavis.edu) to request the training and copy Tiffany. These trainings are long, but that is because they cover safety in sufficient detail to be useful. Although it's technically possible to "test out" of the training with the quiz, I expect you to watch the videos in full with your full attention and then completing the quiz. 

    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals (Initial Training)
    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals Refresher  
    1. eCourse:Cryogen Safety 
    1. Proper Handling of Materials at Biosafety Level 1 
    1. UC DAVIS BIOSAFETY LEVEL 2 ONLINE TRAINING
    1. Safe Use of Biological Safety Cabinets

* **Department Safety Training**. Navigate to to the Department's Safety website. Familiarize yourself with the contents.  Review and sign the following documents (XXX Note: We need to clarify with Andy Ross how to Read/sign these since we aren't required to keep paper copies)
    * Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP)
    * Emergency Action Plan (EAP)

* **Lab-Specific Safety Training**. Before experiments begin in the lab, you'll need to go through the initial safety training with the lab's safety coordinator. 

* **Safety questions**.  It is important to identify safety risks and work with Tiffany, labmates, and EH&S to identify safe ways to proceed. Bring up all safety concerns on the lab's Slack (there is a #safety channel) to open a discussion. Public discussion will help your labmates also adopt safety best-practices.

* **Lab-safe clothing**--make sure you have appropriate attire:
    * **Shoes**: closed-toe, closed heel. Non-absorbant material is *strongly* recommended. 
        * Need inspiration for smart-looking shoes that are also lab safe? Check out online communities: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=lab+shoes&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=lab+shoes&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). 
    * **Pants / other bottoms**: Between tall socks, leggings, or pants, you'll need to ensure you don't have skin exposed. 
    * Avoid clothing/hairstyles that are too drapey & could fall into a bunsen burner / beaker of bacteria / etc. (Especially trendy sleeves on shirts). 

## Misc.

### Where to find administrative help (HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc)

The Plant Pathology dept shares admin staff with the Entomology & Nematology depts. They are named the Phoenix Cluster. Familiarize yourself with [the Phoenix Website](https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/)--especially the links to the side of the page. Also, you might have reasons to direct questions to a specific department (e.g. HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc.), so you can find their (mailing lists here)[https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/departmental-mailing-lists]. The staff's offices are located on the 3rd floor of Hutchison and in Briggs Hall, and they are friendly people who can help you with walk-in questions. 

Tiffany and current lab members can also point you in the direction of an admin to help you solve your problems. 

# Living in Davis

## Places to find short-term rentals (< 1 yr>)

This will take effort. Davis is a small college town & the rental market is heavily tied to the academic year.  We should try to time short-visits to academic year (operates on quarter system [Find dates on UCD website](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/calendar/quarter)). Housing will be cheapest over summer quarter when undergrads vacate apartments. 

There are a few Communities where you can find open rooms:
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/286762898448011/ UC Davis Housing--Grad/Professional Students
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/763250590497811/ UC Davis Off-Campus Housing
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/536715989682604/ Apt/Rooms for Rent for our International Davis Community
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/335826596627749/ University of California, Davis (UCD) Housing, Sublets & Roommates
- https://campuscribz.com/map?location=38.54783,-121.74090&zoom=15 UC Davis â€“ CampusCribz

This is just a starter list. Craigslist and AirBnB are also potential options.

Once again, the [Maloof lab](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/wiki/) at UC Davis has some great information.
