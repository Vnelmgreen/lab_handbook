# Onboarding

Important information for new hires. We highly recommend getting a UCD email address before arriving.  This will allow you to complete online safety training before arriving in the lab, which is necessary if you want to hit the ground running.  It is also okay if you do not complete all training before your first day, but you cannot work until you complete the training. 

As a new member in the lab, please contribute to this document to help streamline the process for future people who join the lab. 

**Before you work in the lab**

## Expectations

Familiarize yourself with the [lab handbook](lab_handbook.md). You don't have to remember all of the details. But you should read it carefully at least once.  And then go back to re-read specific sections when it is appropriate. It is a single document to make it easy to Ctrl+F Search. 
 To finish:

## Required Training

In addition to the safety training here, please follow the safety best practices in lab protocols, and work to identify hazards and work safely around them. 

UCD **Online safety training** through (LMS)[https://lms.ucdavis.edu/] aka UC Learning Center. Look for the courses below in `Required Training`. If you do not see them, use the `Find A Course` search. If all else fails, email the plant pathology Safety guru Andy Ross (abross@ucdavis.edu) to request the training and copy Tiffany. These trainings are long, but that is because they cover safety in sufficient detail to be useful. Although it's technically possible to "test out" of the training with the quiz, I expect you to watch the videos in full with your full attention and then completing the quiz. 

    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals (Initial Training)
    1. eCourse:UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals Refresher  
    1. eCourse:Cryogen Safety 
    1. Proper Handling of Materials at Biosafety Level 1 
    1. UC DAVIS BIOSAFETY LEVEL 2 ONLINE TRAINING
    1. Safe Use of Biological Safety Cabinets

**Department Safety Training**. Navigate to to the Department's Safety website. Familiarize yourself with the contents.  Review and sign the following documents (XXX Note: We need to clarify with Andy Ross how to Read/sign these since we aren't required to keep paper copies)
    * Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP)
    * Emergency Action Plan (EAP)

**Lab-Specific Safety Training**. Before experiments begin in the lab, you'll need to go through the initial safety training with the lab's safety coordinator. 

## Integrating into the team
- Add yourself to the [Lab Contact Sheet](https://cutt.ly/lpl_contact)
- Once you create a slack account, introduce yourself in the **#general** channel. 
- Add yourself to the lab website
- If you get access before your start-date, add your "first day of work" to the lab-events calendar.  This way everyone greats you. :)

# Misc.

## Where to find administrative help (HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc)

The Plant Pathology dept shares admin staff with the Entomology & Nematology depts. They are named the Phoenix Cluster. Familiarize yourself with [the Phoenix Website](https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/)--especially the links to the side of the page. Also, you might have reasons to direct questions to a specific department (e.g. HR, Purchasing, Travel, IT, etc.), so you can find their (mailing lists here)[https://phoenix.ucdavis.edu/departmental-mailing-lists]. The staff's offices are located on the 3rd floor of Hutchison and in Briggs Hall, and they are friendly people who can help you with walk-in questions. 

Tiffany and current lab members can also point you in the direction of an admin to help you solve your problems. 

## Living in Davis

The [Maloof lab](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/wiki/) at UC Davis has some great information.

### Places to find short-term rentals (< 1 yr>)

This will take effort. Davis is a small college town & the rental market is heavily tied to the academic year.  We should try to time short-visits to academic year (operates on quarter system [Find dates on UCD website](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/calendar/quarter)). Housing will be cheapest over summer quarter when undergrads vacate apartments. 

There are a few Communities where you can find open rooms:
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/286762898448011/ UC Davis Housing--Grad/Professional Students
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/763250590497811/ UC Davis Off-Campus Housing
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/536715989682604/ Apt/Rooms for Rent for our International Davis Community
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/335826596627749/ University of California, Davis (UCD) Housing, Sublets & Roommates
- https://campuscribz.com/map?location=38.54783,-121.74090&zoom=15 UC Davis â€“ CampusCribz

This is just a starter list. Craigslist and AirBnB are also potential options.

# Undergraduate-specific information
You will be paired with a mentor. The mentor will usually be a current graduate student, junior specialist, postdoc, or rarely the principle investigator (Tiffany). This mentor is volunteering their time to train you. Please respect their time and expertise. Mentored research is a great opportunity to be apprenticed by a scientist and learn both techniques and critical thinking skills. The amount of learning and experience you gain from this experience is proportional to your motivation, curiosity, and attention. If you are too busy to fully participate and take advantage of this opportunity in a certain quarter, communicate that.  This will allow our lab to use our finite time to mentor someone who can take advantage of the opportunity.
