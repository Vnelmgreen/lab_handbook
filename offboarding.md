# Offboarding

Thanks for being a part of the lab! 

## Everyone: Turn in your keys to the Phoenix Purchasing office

## Everyone: Organize your files

* Make sure all of your data / planning documents / code is backed up to a location where future lab members can access it. This could be Box.com, One-Drive, GitHub, or completely pubic platforms like Zenodo and FigShare.

## Lab workers: Organize your freezer / fridge / bench space
* Make sure the following items are organized and stored:
  * Bacterial stocks (cryostorage in -80C).  Back-up all Ralstonia in our basement -80C. All plasmids should be stored in an E. coli strain (Upstairs -80C Freezer)
  * Primers can be consolidated into the minimum number of -20 boxes. Only keep the IDT stocks, not your working stocks.
  * Common plasmids and gDNAs can be gifted to a labmate or put in the "common plasmids"/"common gDNA" box *if and only if you trust it. If you don't trust it, toss it.*
* Please lead a excel spreadsheet map of any freezer boxes you leave behind. 

Dispose of:
* old PCR products
* Primer working stocks
* Digested plasmids
* Project-specific plasmids that no one is likely to use in the next year. (If someone wants to use these in 3 years, they will make a fresh prep from the lab E. coli stocks).
* Papers/post-it notes/etc. 

Clean up: 
* Defrost extra boxes; let them dry; put them back in lab storage.
* Return tube racks to where they will be useful.
* Dispose of any solutions **properly** unless someone wants to inherit a specific one from you.  If so, move the solution to their bench/storage areas.
* Return your pipettes to the common lab drawer. **Note:** For long-term storage, pipettes should be adjusted to their maximum volume (e.g. 1000 for the p1000) because this preserves the spring mechanism and the accuracy of the pipette. 

Your lab bench and shelf area should be completely or mostly cleared off. Wipe it down and make it look nice. 

## Desk workers: Organize your desk
Get rid of papers.  Gift person objects / tokens to people or takent hem with you. Clean the dust and crumbs. 

## Researchers: Discuss authorship on any projects that remain open. 
* Write down a list of open projects and what your contributions were.
* Decide what your desired level of contribution is to open projects after you leave. The minimum is that you will need to review manuscripts, provide edits, and approve your authorship. If you do not do this, the ethical thing is for us to acknowledge you.  If you had a very major role in a project and it is nearly complete, you can continue writing or analyzing data outside of your "working hours" of your next position.  It is okay if you do not have time to do this. But if someone else fills in, this might change contributions and result in an updated authorship order. 
* Upload the document to your digital lab notebook in an obvious-to-find location.

Have a meeting about your projects with Tiffany.  Also send your project contribution list to your collaborators and ask them to discuss any differences of opinion. Our goal is to not forget to give you middle authorship for your contributions, but please advocate for yourself.  Depending on the project, the scope might change after you leave the group, which might update authorship order. Our goal is to be fair and to publish the science that we do. 

In most cases, undergraduates will not be first-authors on papers. This is because we usually try to focus on providing you training. We are likely to provide you a lot of small opportunities that contribute to projects, but you are unlikely to develop/carry a project to the scale that a grad student / postdoc / junior specialist would.
