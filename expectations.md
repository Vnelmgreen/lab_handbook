# Expectations

Please **read** and **sign** the [lab mentoring contract](files/Lowe-Power_Mentoring_Contract.docx) and email it to Tiffany. 

## Meetings with your Mentor

* **Research meetings**: Full-time labbies (postdocs, graduate students, junior specialists, etc) should schedule weekly 1-on-1 research meetings (1 hr) with Tiffany. 
    * Tiffany prefers afternoon meetings (trying to reserve mornings for concentrated work: grant writing, manuscript revisions, etc). 
    * Once your project takes off, we will convert to every-other-week research meetings.
* To get the most out of meetings with your mentor, prioritize the facetime and manage your mentor.  
[**Essential Reading**: What to bring to a meeting with your advisor](http://www.avasthilab.org/2017/03/14/what-to-bring-to-a-meeting-with-your-advisor/)
    * This especially applies to 1-on-1 research meetings with Tiffany.  
    * Undergrads: at early stages, your graduate student / postdoc mentor will work directly with you.  But you should work independently to deepen your understanding of your project & protocol details. Our goal is for you to reach autonomy/indepedence and manage your mentor as described above. 
* **Literature meetings**: For the first 6 months - 1 year, graduate students (required) and postdocs (encouraged) should schedule weekly 1-on-1 literature meetings (30 min) with Tiffany. 
    * **Purpose**: To get up to speed on the literature, new lab members will do an in-depth read of at least 1 research article related to their project (their choice, but some options are on the [Recommended Reading doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P-1xsSmAvdl-zBIPTzegvSQwl7Bo9lA3qmXo16owYDA/edit#heading=h.jhbq16rd80b). Request access).  
    * **Format**: The labby will verbally present this paper to Tiffany in a < 30 min meeting (no slides, but a written outline + printed papers will keep you on track).
        * Core structure:
            * What is the main question of the paper?
            * What are the key findings?
            * How does this paper inform your project?
        * Optional content:
            * Did the authors fairly interpret their data or are there instances where they overstated any findings? (If so, how could they walk back those claims to solid ground? What data would you like to see to directly )
            * What methods were used to address these questions?  Were they appropriate methods?  Were appropriate controls in place?
            * Is there anything that you just don't understand after reasonable effort to figure it out yourself? (Tiffany may know the answer. Most likely will provide advice on additional ways to figure it out yourself.) 
    
* **Career Planning meetings**: In January and July, Tiffany will hold career planning meetings with full-time labbies. 
      * We will follow [these guidelines](files/career_meeting_guidelines.pdf) 

## Making Reproducible Research a Priority

Follow the [lab organization](organization.md) guidelines. If you have suggestions on more effective/efficient methods, we can bring it to a vote in the lab Slack. Tiffany will be the final decision maker because organization must be implemented top-down for the whole team to buy-in.  You are always welcome to improve your personal organization above the lab standard.
