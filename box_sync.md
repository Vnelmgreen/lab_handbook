# Individual lab notebooks

Disclaimer: All data and notebooks are property of the lab.  However, you are welcome to keep access to your data and files to both help you write/analyze data remotely and wrap up any papers that trail behind your tenure in the lab. Additionally, you can keep access to your protocols/methods and other information in your notebook to reference as you move onward and upward in your career. 

## Management of the individual lab notebook

* Download and install Box Sync. 

* Get access to the `LowePowerLab - Shared` folder (Request on #onboarding or other Slack channel if no one remembers to invite you). 

* Create a notebook folder within the shared folder using the format `nb - LastName, FirstName`. ("nb" for notbook) **Sync this folder to your computer** and store & organize all of your data within this folder.  

    * Do not sync the whole "LowePowerLab - Shared" folder.  As of 2020, it is 53 Gb. You don't want everything to fill up your computer. 

## Undergrads & Box

* Undergrads will be given **"Uploader, Viewer"** permissions on the `LowePowerLab - Shared`, but they will not have the ability to delete or Sync this folder to their computer. They can view the folder contents through the Box.com website interface.

* Undergrad lab notebooks will be stored in an independent shared folder  `LowePowerLab - Ugrad`. Undergrads will have editor access to this folder. They should create a folder `nb - LastName, FirstName`. ("nb" for notbook) **Sync this folder to their  computer** and store & organize all of their data within this folder.  

# Backing up Box folders

Lab notebook folders are required to be backed up every 12 months.  It is strongly recommended to back up every 6 months.  All non-replaceable data should be backed up ASAP.  You probably want to do this at the end of the day because files might become inaccessible during backup

# Sharing Resources (Folders with 1 -)

* Optional -- sync all the folders that begin with "1 -".  These folders include scientific, science-communication, and other professional development resources that you may find helpful. Please contribute to them as seen fit.  If you add any resources that you want to call attention to -- use the lab Slack.
